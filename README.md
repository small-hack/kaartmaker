# Make labeled maps of continental regions

I got the data from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/

I downloaded the map sovereignty, units, subunits, and disputed areas from:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-details/

You can do the same with the [download_geojson.sh](./download_geojson.sh) script in this repo.

## Secondary features

You can also generate geojson files for specific regions :)
